
1. What is a React component? (It is a function that returns React elements) (is it UI)

A react component is a an element from react that act like we want it to work

2. What's wrong with this code?
```
function myComponent() {
    return (
        <small>I'm tiny text!</small>
    )
}
```
the function must begin with a capital letter(?)


3. What's wrong with this code?
```
function Header() {
    return (
        <header>
            <img src="./react-logo.png" width="40px" alt="React logo" />
        </header>
    )
}

root.render(Header())

if you want the function show in the page it must be between <> (angle brackets) similar to HTML 
to signify React and tell it to create an isntance of the REACT ELEMENT Header and then compiled it in JavaScript objects and React interprets as real elements in the DOM (document)
